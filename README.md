Currently, universities and educational institutions collect and store a huge amount of data such as personal and educational information of students. The huge growth of electronic data in universities points to the fact that by using traditional methods, it is not possible to achieve the desired results in the fields of education and research. Now, there is the issue of what are the most important characteristics of students to predict their academic progress and which algorithm is more suitable for making this prediction, and if these results are reached, how can managers plan better. In this article, all the possible characteristics of students, collected and some data mining algorithms as well as a proposed method were implemented on the data and the obtained results were checked and compared with each other. The results of the investigations indicate that the proposed method performed better than the applied algorithms in terms of accuracy, and the most important characteristics affecting the academic progress of the students were also identified. By using this prediction, managers can also remove the obstacles and provide the ground for the progress of students
